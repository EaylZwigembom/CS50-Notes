It would be very tedious if you needed to remember an IP address to visit a website.

__DNS__, or __domain name systems__, is a collection of servers on the internet that are used to route website addresses like __harvard.edu__ to a specific IP address.

DNS is simply a table or database that links specific, fully qualified domain names to specific IP addresses.
