In previous weeks, we introduced you to Python, a high-level programming language that utilized the same building blocks we learned in C. However, we introduced this new language not for the purpose of learning “just another language.” Instead, we do so because some tools are better for some jobs and not so great for others!

This week, we will be continuing more syntax related to Python.

Further, we will be integrating this knowledge with data.

Finally, we will be discussing __SQL__ or __Structured Query Language__, a domain-specific way by which we can interact with and modify data.

Overall, one of the goals of this course is to learn to program generally – not simply how to program in the languages described in this course.
