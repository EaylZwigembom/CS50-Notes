Dictionaries_ are another data structure.
Dictionaries, like actual book-form dictionaries that have a word and a definition, have a __key__ and a __value__.
The __holy grail__ of algorithmic time complexity is **O(1)** or **constant time**. That is, the ultimate is for access to be instantaneous.    ![a graph of various time complexities where O of log n is second best and O of 1 is best](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/notes/5/cs50Week5Slide151.png "time complexity")

Dictionaries can offer this speed of access through hashing.
