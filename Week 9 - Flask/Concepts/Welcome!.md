In previous weeks, you have learned numerous programming languages, techniques, and strategies.

Indeed, this class has been far less of a __C class__ or __Python class__ and far more of a __programming class__, such that you can go on to follow future trends.

In these past several weeks, you have learned __how to learn__ about programming.

Today, we will be moving from HTML and CSS into combining HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, and JavaScript so you can create your own web applications.

You might consider using the skills you learn this week to create your final project.
