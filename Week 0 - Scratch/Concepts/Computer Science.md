#Computer-Science

Computer science is the study of information, How do you represent it and how do you process it.

#### **Computational Thinking**

 The application of ideas from computer science to solve problems.


#### **Problem Solving**
^Problem-Solving

You can view problem solving with this mental image:

You got a **==problem==** to solve thus known as the **==input==** you want to solve, And the **==output==** in this model will be the **solution**. What you're going to learn is how to ==**produce**== the solution.

But before we can do that, we first have to agree on a way to **==represent==** these ==**inputs**== and ==**outputs**==, especially if we want to do that in a standardized global way using literally computers (Laptops, Desktops, Phones, etc...).


#### **Here is a list of ways we can represent information:**

[[Unary]]
[[Binary]]
[[ASCII]]
[[Unicode]]
[[Color]]
