**emojis** are like ==**fonts**==, they are just **0**'s and **1**'s but the **==Unicode==** system made the computer interpret them to display what known today the emoji.
A single **emoji** is made out of 32 bits([[Binary#^bits]]). 
Also the **emojis** will look different on different devices or apps because each company like Apple, google, etc.. has their own **designers** on staff and that lead to to each company having a unique look for their emojis.


**But how does the computer know how to display what color?** --> [[Color]]
