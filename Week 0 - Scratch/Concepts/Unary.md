#Unary

Let's say a teacher is taking attendance old-school style in a small class. He would **==count==** the students with his **fingers** **(`1` student = `1` finger up)**. 
He's using his fingers literally as **==digits==**.

That way of counting is known as **unary notation** and also known mathematically as **`base-1`**. 

#### **Base-1**
**`Base-1`** is a way of **==representing==** numbers with only **==one symbol==** (Usually "**`1`**").
A number is represented by **`n`** **repetitions** of that symbol. 

**Note:** Each repetition can be viewed as `1` finger up.

#### **For example**
the number **`4`** in ==**Base-1/Unary notation**== will be represented as "**`1111`**".
