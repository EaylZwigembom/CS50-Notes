#Encryption #Cryptography

**Cryptography** is **==scrambling information to be able to communicate securely==**. Whether it's a private message you want to say, or your credit card information, or a password for an account.

Here is an example for a message, so called **==cypher text==**, that's been scrambled:

You can see that this message makes no sense, it's **==encrypted==**([[Encryption]]) and it was scrambled in some way, but if we manage to de-scramble the letters. We will get this:

The cypher text scrambled the message: **This is cs50** **==by replacing every letter with the letter that comes after it==**. U comes after T, I comes after H, and so on.
