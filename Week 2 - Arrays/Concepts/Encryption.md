Cryptography is the art of ciphering and deciphering a message.
 Now, with the building block of arrays, chars, and strings, you can cipher and decipher a message.
`plaintext` and a `key` are provided to a `cipher`, resulting in ciphered text.

The key is a special argument passed to the cipher along with the plaintext. The cipher uses the key to make decisions about how to implement its cipher algorithm.
