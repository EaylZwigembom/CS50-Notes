#Week-Overview 

In this week, we learned how the building blocks of programming from prior lessons can be implemented within Python. Further, you learned about how Python allowed for more simplified code. Also, you learned how to utilize various Python libraries. In the end, you learned that your skills as a programmer are not limited to a single programming language. Already, you are seeing how you are discovering a new way of learning through this course that could serve you in any programming language – and, perhaps, in nearly any avenue of learning! Specifically, we discussed…
