Data types in Python do not need to be explicitly declared. For example, you saw how `answer` above is a string, but we did not have to tell the interpreter this was the case: It knew on its own.

In Python, commonly used types include:
```
      bool
      float
      int
      str
```

Notice that `long` and `double` are missing. Python will handle what data type should be used for larger and smaller numbers.

 Some other data types in Python include:

```
    range   sequence of numbers
    list    sequence of mutable values
    tuple   sequence of immutable values
    dict    collection of key-value pairs
	set     collection of unique values
```    

Each of these data types can be implemented in C, but in Python, they can be implemented more simply.
