#python

In C, you may have seen functions as follows:
```
printf("hello, world\n");
```

In Python, you will see functions as follows:
```
    print("hello, world")
```

Notice that the differences are: 
1. python **doesn't** need a **semicolon**.
2. you **don't** need to type **`\n`**
3. you type **print** instead of **printf**

In C, you may have declared functions as follows:
```
void Functiomn(<Function Parameters>)
{
	// Code
}
```

In Python, you will **define** functions as follows:
```
    def Functiomn(<Function Parameters>):
	    # Code
```

Notice that instead of declaring the **return value** of the function you just use the keyword **`def`**, which means **define**, Also notice that instead of curly braces we do **`:`**
